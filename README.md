# Chess game made in ruby

Basic chess game.

I Recommend to play when using the command line on windows with MS Gothic as font and bold fonts checked otherwise The pieces are not going to be very visible.

The program is complete, Albeit i would still need to add a "PC" controlled partner to play, Right now it's just two players only game.
